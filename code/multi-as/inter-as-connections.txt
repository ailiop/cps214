# configuration script 'multiAS-fullprot.ns'. As such, it is (and has to
# be) independent of the IPs of the routers.
#
# The inter-AS network topology described by this descriptor file is as
# follows:
#
#       --------      --------      --------      --------
#       | AS 1 |------| AS 2 |------| AS 3 |------| AS 4 |

#                        |      __/    |
#                        |     /       |   
#                        |    /        |
